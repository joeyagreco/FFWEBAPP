        AWAL stands for Adjusted Wins Against the League. It is exactly that, an adjustment added to the Wins Against the League (or <span class="link" onclick="reroute('WAL')">WAL</span>) of a team.<br>
        In simple terms, this stat more accurately represents how many WAL any given team should have.<br>
        Ex: A team with 6.3 AWAL "deserves" 6.3 WAL.
